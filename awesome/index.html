            <p> Different browsers interpret HTML/CSS differently. If a user is on an older or less standard-compliant browser, they may not see the page as intended.
              Ad blockers can sometimes block more than just ads; they might interfere with the loading of certain page elements or scripts, leading to a broken page.</p>
